# Personal Projects

This repository is a list of all the small to medium sized personal projects I have done and are separated into the main language I used to create them. This main repository is meant to store all the projects I have done that are on the smaller side or are basic ideas taken from the internet while also directing people to my other bigger projects (that are yet to be made).

### Additional Note
Before I made this repository, I didn't keep track of my projects (mainly just the first 2 java projects: [Calculator w/o a GUI](https://github.com/Dossr-NK/Personal-Projects/tree/main/Java/Calculator%20no%20GUI) and [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/Dossr-NK/Personal-Projects/tree/main/Java/Tic%20Tac%20Toe)) so there are no dates listed for these projects. After these projects, I will have dates for when I created them.

<!-- Will add ## Larger Projects List later when I create one. -->

## Contributing
Although all of these projects will be on the smaller side, I still tend to make mistakes, miss things, or unknowningly(or knowingly) make bugs throughout my projects. Any help would be greate in either creating an issue if you find a bug or creating a pull request to fix a bug. The process of contributing are written under each project, although they are all the same or pretty similar.
