# Personal Projects

This repository is a list of all the personal projects I have done and are separated into the main language I used to create them. Along with that, the projects are listed below into projects that I have done in 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and more than 1 month with their corresponding main language listed right next to it. It also includes any learning I have done from YouTube videos or elsewhere.

### Additional Note
Before I made this repository, I didn't keep track of my projects (mainly just the first 2 java projects: [Calculator w/o a GUI](https://github.com/Dossr-NK/Personal-Projects/tree/main/Java/Calculator%20no%20GUI) and [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/Dossr-NK/Personal-Projects/tree/main/Java/Tic%20Tac%20Toe)) so there are no dates listed for these projects. After these projects, I will have dates for when I created them.
