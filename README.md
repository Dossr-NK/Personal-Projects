# Personal Projects <!-- Will no longer hold specific dates for projects, only MM/YYYY format. -->
This repository serves as a main hub that lists all the projects I have done that can be seen on my github. It separates each project into the primary language that was used to create the project (in the future when I create projects that use multiple languages, I might rearrange this readme to sort by difficulty instead).
