# Learning C
Learning C is a folder for all the things I have learned throughout YouTube Videos, College Courses, and anything else that has taught me useful things for C. The main purpose isn't to be run, it is just meant for me to reference when I get stuck on syntax so this is just here for helping me on that. Below are the [resources](#resources) that I used to learn and which file compiles all the information.
