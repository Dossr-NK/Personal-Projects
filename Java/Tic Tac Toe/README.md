# Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe is my attempt of recreating the game in Java using Java Swing as the main framework for a GUI since I didn't want it to be a command line based game. For those who don't know how Tic Tac Toe works, the game is played within a 3x3 grid and the first person who gets three of their marks ('X' or 'O') wins the game.

#### Additional Notes
There is a known bug at the start of each game where a new Welcome Screen pops up right after the first press of the game along with the frame never closing after consecutive games. I am trying to find a fix, but any help is appreciated. If you want to help then follow the steps in [Contributions](#contributions).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Java JRE 1.8
- Java JDK 21 (optional)

### Clone the Repository
First clone the repository and navigate to the source files for the Tic Tac Toe game.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Personal-Projects.git
cd ../Personal-Projects/Java/"Tic Tac Toe"/src
```
 
### Running the game
Once you are in the directory of the game run the following commands to build the game and play:
```bash
javac GameBoard.java
java GameBoard
```
This builds the GameBoard file and then runs the GameBoard class which has the main that runs the game in it. Then it will open a welcome screen where you just press "Enter the Game" and start playing!
